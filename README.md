# ü©∫ Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning  

This project focuses on **early detection of melanoma** using deep learning techniques applied to the **Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset**.  
Melanoma is a dangerous form of skin cancer, and timely detection can save lives. By combining **image preprocessing** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this project aims to classify skin lesions into melanoma and non-melanoma categories.

## üìå Objectives  
- Preprocess dermoscopic images using augmentation, normalization, and resizing.  
- Train and evaluate CNN-based models for skin lesion classification.  
- Experiment with transfer learning models such as **ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet**.  
- Provide an open framework for research and educational purposes.

## üîß Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset**: Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000
